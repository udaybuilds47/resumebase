# resumebase — own your job search

i graduated last december. it took 6 months of grinding applications and endless rejections to land a role.

the market is brutal. the process is broken. it’s not just about jobs — it’s about survival.

resumebase is an open-source job agent:
- reads the job
- rewrites your resume
- fills the forms
- applies for you

what works today:
- drop a resume and a job link — it applies
- live session viewer
- recording api

what’s next:
- job search and sourcing
- recommendations and ranking
- custom resumes per job
- verification and replay ui

join the build. design, engineering, product — whatever you can offer.

buttons:
- get started (github)
- read the docs (readme)
- join the discussion (issues)

logos: browserbase, stagehand, next.js, tailwind, shadcn/ui
